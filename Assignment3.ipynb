    "## Motivation and Goals\n",
    "For this assignment, we received a database of a booter Website, called TWBooter. This information was leaked by a cybersecurity journalist. Our task is to analyze the database and answer questions about different findings. \n",
    "During this assignment, we hope to get more information about what kinds of data can be leaked, how extensive the data is, and what information the data tells us. It is interesting to see details, like how many users were registered, and how many of them actually used the website for an attack. Furthermore, information like the duration of the attack can tell us more about what the attack was used for. After completing this assignment, we hope to be able to use the gained knowledge and be able to analyze other leaked databases. \n"

    "## Methodology\n",
    "To get our results, we analyze the database in an Excel and tableau spreadsheet. By applying different formulas, we are able to get information about unique user IDs, domain names or attack types. Using these techniques, we will answer 9 questions. The answers and results of our findings can be found in the next section."
